    "# Mobile Application Market Research Project\n",

    "The ACME Corporation is seeking to improve our mobile applications to engage better with our customers.  The goal of this project is to find a mobile application profile that will attract more customers and make the app more profitable.  We are working as a data science consultant assisting the ACME app developers make data-driven decisions regarding what types of apps they should be building.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACME only builds apps that are free to install with their main source of revenue from in-app ads.  The number of users reflects how much revenue is generated from a particular app.  By analyzing how their users engage with apps, we can use this information to attract more customers.  \n",

    "## Obtaining the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen two of the most popular mobile app platforms to do research on, Google Play and Apple's App Store.  As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps in Apple's App Store and 2.1 million Android apps in the Google Play Store.  Since compiling all the data for both of these platforms would take a tremendous amount of time and effort, we have chosen to analyze only a sample of data.  We have also decided not to collect the data ourselves because it would cost a significant amount of additional resources.  We are deriving the basis of our analysis from the following sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/home) from approximately 10,000 Android apps from the Google Play store.\n",
    "   * A [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/home) from approximately 7,200 iOS apps from Apple's App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by open both data sets and exploring how the data is formatted for a small sample of the data."

    " \n",
    "ACME is only interested in the English speaking market, so we'll write some code to remove any non-English apps in the database.  One approach to remove non-English apps is to remove apps that have symbols that aren't used in the English language, such as letters from the English alphabet, numbers, punctuation marks, and other symbols (i.e. +, -, *, /).\n",
    " \n",
    "Each character is encoded numerically using the ASCII standard.  Most characters that are used in the English language falls into the ASCII range between 0 and 127.\n",
    " \n",
    "Below, we built the function IsEnglishWord() to determine if a string is made up of mostly English words.  The function uses the ord() method to convert the character to a number so we can determine if it's in the English character range.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, filtering out characters outside of ASCII 0-127 isn't sufficient for our needs.  This method also filters out emoji characters that are outside of this ASCII range.\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize the unnecessary data loss, we'll only remove an app if it has more than three non-English ASCII characters:"
