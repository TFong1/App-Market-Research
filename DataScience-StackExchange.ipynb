    "# Popular Data Science Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The ACME Corporation is looking for new content regarding our recent decision to create books, on-line articles, or videos in the field of data science.  This analysis will help us determine what is the best content to get started with.  We have determined to analyze the most popular questions on the question and answer on-line forum known as Stack Exhchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stack Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack Exchange is a web site where users can ask and answer questions from other users of the site.  The site is organized various topics, such as Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The site allows users to rate the quality of the questions asked.  The higher rated questions appear near the top of the list of questions to highlight quality questions.  Users can also rate the answers and the highest rated answer is highlighted after the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Data Science](https://datascience.stackexchange.com) Stack Exchange web site allows questions and answers for Data Science professionals, Machine Learning specialists, and individuals who wish to learn more about data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What kinds of questions are accepted?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Data Science Stack Exchange help center's [asking questions FAQ](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/asking), the following guidelines should be followed:\n",
    "* Avoid asking subjective questions\n",
    "* Avoid asking duplicate questions (duplicate questions are flagged accordingly)\n",
    "* Ask only relavant and appropriate questions in regards to data science\n",
    "    * For instance, asking questions regarding programming without reference to data is should be asked in the [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) forum instead of stack exchange.\n",
    "* Ask specific questions\n",
    "* Make questions relavant to others\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these characteristics should be helpful in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The help center's page also refers several sites that may be of relevance to our analysis:\n",
    "* [Open Data](https://opendata.stackexchange.com/) for dataset requests\n",
    "* [Computational Science](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/) for software packages and algorithms in applied mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are questions subdivided?\n",
    "\n",
    "On the [home](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/) page, there are four sections:\n",
    "* [Questions](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions) - list of all questions asked\n",
    "* [Tags](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/tags) - list of tags (keywords or labels that categorize questions). Users can also assign \"Tags\" to each question to make it easier to search for and organize questions by topic.\n",
    "* [Users](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/users) - list of registered users on Stack Exchange\n",
    "* [Unanswered](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/unanswered) - list of unanswered questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The tagging system used by Stack Exchange could be helpful in our analysis as it will allow us to quantify how many questions were asked about a particular subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions in the Stack Exhange's sites are heavily moderated by the community, which will give us confidence in the validity of the tagging system and provide us with accurate conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What information is available in each post?\n",
    "\n",
    "For both questions and answers:\n",
    "* Rating or score (as a numerical value; higher the number, higher the rating)\n",
    "* Title\n",
    "* Author\n",
    "* Body of post\n",
    "\n",
    "For questions only:\n",
    "* Last time the question was active\n",
    "* How many times the question was viewed\n",
    "* Related questions\n",
    "* Tags associated with the question"
